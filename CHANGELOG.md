## [Beta 4] - 2025-02

### Features

- **MOD Import Wizard**: The import dialog is now a full wizard with live memory
  budget estimation. New features:

  - **Target machine selection**: Choose memory config (64 KB to 1088 KB) before
    import. The wizard shows how much space is available for song data vs samples
    and updates in real-time as you change options.

  - **Per-row volume control**: Faithfully imports volume slides and set-volume
    effects using per-position patterns with volume simulation. The wizard shows
    the estimated pattern count and data size for both ON and OFF.

  - **Extend looped instruments**: Unrolls loop regions using Sustain effect.
    Now includes a max repeats control (1–64) and a per-instrument table showing
    name, calculated repeats, and resulting size — so you can spot memory-hungry
    instruments and cap them.

  - **Pattern deduplication**: Automatically merges identical patterns after
    import, which is especially effective when volume control creates per-position
    patterns. Typical reduction: 40–60% fewer patterns.

  - **Song truncation**: When song data overflows, the wizard shows an
    Adjustments section with the option to keep only the first N positions.

  - **Live budget bar**: Shows estimated song data vs available space with
    percentage and fit/overflow status, updating instantly as options change.

- **Instrument Export**: The Sample Editor now has an Export button in the bottom
  bar. Exports the processed audio (with all effects applied) to WAV, and
  additionally to FLAC, OGG, or MP3 when ffmpeg is available. Uses the native
  save dialog with format filters.

- **Cell color palettes**: Pattern editor cells can be colored by note pitch,
  instrument number, volume level, or pattern number. Four multi-color palettes
  (Chromatic, Pastel, Neon, Warm) provide 16 distinct colors each, plus six
  single-color palettes (White, Green, Amber, Cyan, Blue, Pink). Each column
  has an independent palette selector in Editor → Settings, with a live preview
  strip showing all 16 colors. Pattern coloring applies everywhere pattern
  numbers appear: Song grid cells, per-channel pattern combos in the editor
  header, the Pattern section selector, and the instrument selector combo.
  Default palette is Chromatic for all columns. Settings are stored in the
  local editor config, not in .pvq project files.

- **VU meters**: Four vertical bars in the SONG INFO panel show per-channel
  activity during playback. Each bar spikes up on note trigger (height
  proportional to volume) and decays smoothly downward. Color-coded to
  match channel headers (red/green/blue/amber) with bright peak caps and
  subtle glow. Zero CPU cost when silent (drawing skipped entirely).

- **Volume-change events (V--)**: New event type that changes a channel's
  volume without interrupting the currently playing note. Displayed as "V--" in
  the pattern editor. Two ways to enter manually: press **~** (tilde) in the
  note column to insert V-- with the current brush volume, or simply type a
  volume value in the volume column on an empty row — V-- is inserted
  automatically. Also generated by the MOD importer when volume control is
  enabled. Requires Vol checkbox to be enabled in Song Info.

- **Sustain effect in instrument editor**: Select a region of a sample
  (left-click = start, right-click = end markers) and repeat it 1–64 times with
  optional crossfade smoothing (0–500 ms). Useful for extending short samples
  into longer sustained notes. Available in the Edit toolbar group.

- **"Used Samples" optimization checkbox**: Limits CONVERT and OPTIMIZE to only
  process instruments actually referenced in the song. Unused instruments are
  skipped during conversion and excluded from the memory budget. The optimizer
  shows a gray "–" next to unused instruments.

- **Configurable Start Address**: Set the player's ORG address ($0800–$3F00)
  in Song Info. Lower values give more room for sample data. Default $2000.

- **Memory Target selector**: Choose target memory configuration in Song Info:
  64KB (no banking), 128KB (130XE), 320KB, 576KB, 1088KB. Extended memory modes
  use bank-switched sample storage.

- **$C000 boundary check**: Assembly build now fails with a clear error if
  code and data exceed the $C000 OS boundary. The build error dialog shows
  available KB and suggests fixes.

- **Extended memory banking (128KB–1MB)**: Full bank-switched sample storage for
  Atari XL/XE extended RAM. Samples are stored in 16KB banks at $4000–$7FFF,
  switched inline in the IRQ handler. Multi-bank samples >16KB span consecutive
  banks with automatic boundary crossing. Includes RAM detection, multi-segment
  XEX generation, and banking-aware optimization.

### Interface

- **Redesigned main layout — Pattern Editor is now the primary panel**: The
  pattern editor spans the full window height on the left side, giving
  significantly more visible rows for editing (~19 rows at default window size,
  up from ~11). The Song grid, Pattern controls, and Song Info are on the right
  side, with the Instruments panel below them.

- **Settings moved to Editor menu**: Settings (Hex mode, Auto-save, Piano keys,
  Coupled entry) are now accessed via Editor → Settings in the menu bar, opening
  in a modal dialog. This frees up screen space for the pattern editor. All
  editor settings (including cell color palettes) are stored in the local config
  file, not in .pvq project files — so your preferences follow you across
  projects.

- **Mark interval moved to Current section**: The row highlight interval
  selector is now in the CURRENT toolbar alongside Instrument, Volume, Octave,
  and Step — always visible without opening the settings.

- **Real-time CONVERT progress**: The VQ conversion log window now streams
  output line-by-line as the encoder runs, showing iteration progress
  (e.g. "Iteration 12/50...") in real time. Previously output only appeared
  after the entire conversion finished, making it look like the program hung.

- **Effects indicator [E] in instrument list**: Each instrument row now shows
  an [E] button between the optimizer indicator and the instrument name. Blue
  when effects are applied (with tooltip listing effect types), blank otherwise.
  Clicking opens the Sample Editor for that instrument.

- **Detailed BUILD overflow diagnostics**: When song data exceeds the available
  memory region, the build log now shows a per-file breakdown with sizes and
  percentages (e.g. "SONG_DATA.asm: 20,620 bytes (20KB) — 77%"). The pre-flight
  check now runs for banking mode too (previously only 64KB mode), catching
  overflows before invoking MADS. ASM error messages now pinpoint which section
  caused the overflow.

### Performance

- **Optimized IRQ player for RAW samples**: The pitch accumulator for RAW
  (uncompressed) samples has been rewritten to combine two separate addition
  stages into one. For 4 active RAW channels, the player now uses 243 of 392
  available CPU cycles (62%) — down from 345 (88%) previously. This frees up
  149 cycles of headroom per IRQ, enough to comfortably handle occasional page
  crosses or additional processing.

- **Fixed audio stuttering on 4-channel note triggers**: When all 4 channels
  triggered simultaneously (common on the first rows of imported MODs), the
  commit phase ran with interrupts disabled for ~604 cycles — far exceeding the
  392-cycle IRQ period. This caused 1–2 missed IRQs and audible stuttering.
  Fixed by restructuring the commit into three phases: deactivate channels
  (no IRQ blackout needed), set up all data (IRQs fire normally, inactive
  channels are skipped), then briefly re-activate (44 cycles with IRQs
  disabled — down from 604).

- **Pre-baked AUDC volume mode bit**: The POKEY "volume-only mode" flag ($10)
  is now pre-baked into sample data at conversion time, removing one instruction
  from the IRQ hot path. Saves 8 CPU cycles per IRQ across 4 channels.

### Bug Fixes

- **OPTIMIZE ignored sample effects (Sustain, Trim, etc.)**: The optimizer
  used a lazy cache that was cleared whenever effects changed, silently falling
  back to the original unprocessed sample data. A Sustain-extended 15-second
  sample would be analyzed as its original 0.5-second length. Now the optimizer
  explicitly runs the effects pipeline before computing sizes and durations.

- **MOD patterns with Dxx/Bxx played silent tails instead of correct length**:
  Pattern break effects now correctly set the pattern length and trim rows.
  Backward position jumps (song loops) truncate the songline list.

- **Banking system shadow register conflicts**: The extended memory detection
  routine now saves and restores PORTB properly, preventing conflicts with
  the OS shadow register on warm resets.

- **Fixed stale text encoding table comment**: Corrected an outdated comment
  that referenced an old encoding format.

- **Removed dead code**: Cleaned up unused `original_sample_path` field,
  duplicate builder files, and an unused export function from the codebase.

- **Double-sustain on .pvq round-trip**: MOD import overwrote `sample_data`
  with the sustain-extended audio while also storing Sustain in the effects
  chain. After save→load, the pipeline re-applied Sustain to already-extended
  audio, doubling the loop unroll. Now the original audio stays in `sample_data`
  (saved to WAV in .pvq) and the extended version goes to `processed_data`
  (regenerated by the pipeline on load).

- **song.speed not serialized in .pvq**: The initial speed (from the MOD's
  first Fxx command) was lost on save→load, reverting to the default (6).
  Now stored in project.json `meta.speed`.

- **song.volume_control not set on import**: The wizard's "Enable per-row
  volume control" option created volume events in patterns but never set
  `song.volume_control = True`. BUILD would generate ASM without the
  VOLUME_CONTROL flag, so all V-- events were silently ignored by the player.

- **Import wizard crash with no loops**: Clicking Import on a MOD with no
  looped samples crashed because `on_import` read the max_repeats widget
  unconditionally. Now guarded with `does_item_exist()`.

- **Editor preferences overwritten by .pvq load**: Opening a project file
  overwrote hex mode, follow-cursor, octave, and step size with whatever
  was stored in the project. These are now personal settings that persist
  across projects via the local config file and are never changed by loading
  a .pvq.

- **Volume column not shown after MOD import or .pvq load**: Importing a MOD
  with volume control enabled (or loading a .pvq saved with volume on) did
  not rebuild the pattern editor grid. The Vol checkbox appeared checked but
  the volume column was invisible. Now the editor grid is rebuilt whenever
  a song is loaded, imported, or reset — syncing columns with the song's
  volume_control setting.

- **Key handling: cross-platform DPG compatibility**: DearPyGUI key constants
  changed between versions (1.x used GLFW codes, 2.0 uses ImGui enum). Added
  `dpg_keys.py` abstraction layer that tries multiple attribute names for
  version-dependent keys (Prior/PageUp, Next/PageDown, Back/Backspace,
  Open_Brace/LeftBracket, NumPadEnter/KeypadEnter, Grave/GraveAccent).
  Fixes PageUp/PageDown, F1-F3 octave selection, and bracket keys across
  all DPG versions. KEY_MAP is now built at runtime from resolved constants.

- **Tilde key (V-- entry) not working**: Pressing Shift+\` always entered
  note-off instead of V-- because DPG sends the same key code for both \`
  and ~. The keyboard handler now detects shift state and transforms the
  grave character to tilde before passing to handle_char().

## [Beta 3] - 2025-02

### Major Features

- **4-channel polyphonic playback**: Expanded from 3 to 4 independent sample
  channels. All four POKEY audio registers (AUDC1–AUDC4) are now used, giving
  the full hardware polyphony. The 6502 IRQ handler, process_row commit logic,
  and tracker_api all handle 4 channels with complete VQ/RAW mode support.

- **Mixed VQ + RAW sample encoding**: Instruments can now individually use either
  VQ (Vector Quantization) or RAW (uncompressed 4-bit PCM) encoding. VQ gives
  better compression (8:1 with vec_size=8) using a shared 256-entry codebook.
  RAW uses more memory but costs fewer CPU cycles per sample — no codebook
  lookup needed. The player selects the correct handler per channel at note
  trigger time via self-modifying code, with zero overhead during playback.

- **OPTIMIZE button**: Analyzes all instruments and the song arrangement to
  recommend VQ or RAW mode for each instrument. The optimizer simulates
  playback row-by-row to find the worst-case CPU load, then switches short
  or CPU-heavy instruments to RAW when memory allows. After optimization,
  V (VQ) and R (RAW) indicators appear next to each instrument showing the
  recommendation. Toggling an instrument's checkbox preserves these indicators.

- **Amiga MOD import**: Import 4-channel ProTracker .MOD files with automatic
  conversion of patterns, instruments, song arrangement, and speed settings.
  MOD samples are resampled to the POKEY rate and their `base_note` is set to
  C-3 (matching MOD tuning conventions). After import, the optimizer runs
  automatically to assign RAW/VQ modes.

- **Configurable memory limit**: The sample data memory budget is adjustable
  (default 35 KB). The OPTIMIZE button and BUILD process respect this limit
  when deciding how to fit instruments into the Atari's 64 KB RAM.

- **Coupled note entry mode**: New setting (on by default) that controls whether
  entering a note on an occupied cell overwrites the instrument and volume
  (FastTracker 2 style) or preserves them (Renoise-style edit mask). Toggle
  in Settings panel.

- **Clone instrument**: Deep-copies the selected instrument (audio data, effects
  chain, settings) to a new slot at the end of the instrument list.

### Bug Fixes

- **MOD instruments played 2 octaves too high on Atari**: The ASM pitch table
  ignored `base_note`. MOD samples are pitched for C-3 playback, but the
  exporter mapped C-3 to pitch index 24 = 4.0x instead of 1.0x. Fixed by
  extending the pitch table from 36 to 60 entries (5 octaves including 0.25x
  and 0.5x sub-octaves) and applying a base_note correction during export:
  `export_note = gui_note + 24 - (base_note - 1)`.

- **VQ preview cheating vs RAW**: The VQ preview played codebook vectors at
  float32 precision (~24-bit quality) instead of quantizing through the real
  16-level POKEY voltage table. This made VQ sound dramatically better than RAW
  in preview, but the difference does not exist on real hardware. Both VQ and
  RAW previews now go through honest 16-level POKEY quantization.

- **RAW preview used wrong interpolation**: RAW preview used sinc interpolation
  (scipy.signal.resample) creating ringing artifacts. Now uses zero-order hold
  (np.repeat at 1.77 MHz → resample to 48 kHz), matching real POKEY hardware
  sample-and-hold behavior and identical to the VQ preview method.

- **IRQ skip labels fell through into RAW handlers**: Every `chN_skip` label
  in tracker_irq_speed.asm pointed to the same address as `chN_raw_boundary`
  (only comments between, no instructions). On every non-boundary tick, execution
  fell through from skip into the RAW boundary handler. Fixed by placing all RAW
  handlers after the `rti` instruction, reachable only via SMC JMP targets.

- **Branch out of range after removing size optimization**: Removing
  OPTIMIZE_SPEED conditionals made commit blocks exceed the 6502's ±127 byte
  relative branch limit. Fixed by inverting `beq @commit_done_N` to
  `bne @do_commit_N / jmp @commit_done_N`.

- **Atari data size display excluded RAW samples**: The size shown after
  conversion only counted VQ_BLOB + VQ_INDICES. RAW_SAMPLES bytes were never
  added. All-RAW projects showed "2 B". Fixed.

- **Keyboard notes played while typing in Limit field**: The memory limit
  input field did not suppress keyboard note entry, causing notes to trigger
  while typing numbers. Fixed by adding the field to the input-active check list.

- **Optimize indicators disappeared on checkbox toggle**: Clicking a VQ/RAW
  checkbox cleared the optimize result, hiding the V/R recommendation
  indicators. The indicators now persist through checkbox toggles (only cleared
  by operations that change the instrument list or settings).

### Improvements

- **Noise shaping for RAW samples**: 1st-order error-feedback noise shaping
  pushes quantization noise from audible low frequencies to less-audible high
  frequencies. At 15 kHz POKEY rate, noise in the 0–2 kHz band drops by ~18x.
  Auto-enabled when POKEY rate ≥ 6 kHz.

- **2-cycle/channel IRQ optimization**: Data bytes now store raw 0–15 volumes
  instead of pre-baked `$10|vol`. Removes the `AND #$0F` instruction from the
  IRQ hot path, saving 8 cycles per IRQ tick across 4 channels.

- **Removed size-optimized player from tracker**: The tracker now always uses
  the speed-optimized IRQ handler. The size-optimized variant (nibble-packed,
  no RAW support) remains available in the standalone vq_converter.

- **Auto-optimize on MOD import**: After importing a MOD file, the RAW/VQ
  optimizer runs automatically so instruments start with sensible mode
  assignments.

- **Simplified menus**: Removed "Import vq_converter..." and "Export .ASM..."
  menu items. The tracker workflow is now: compose → convert → build (.xex).

## [Beta 2] - 2025-02

### Bug Fixes

- **Windows: WinError 32 when loading .pvq files**: Loading projects failed with
  "The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process".
  Root cause: ZIP archives use forward slashes (`samples/00.wav`) but Windows uses
  backslashes. When checking if source and destination paths were the same,
  string comparison failed due to mixed separators, causing `shutil.copy2()` to
  attempt copying a file onto itself. Fixed with `os.path.normpath()` before
  path comparison. (`file_io.py`)
- **Linux/macOS: FFmpeg not found for MP3 import**: The `_setup_ffmpeg_for_pydub()`
  function only set up the bundled FFmpeg path on Windows. Now works on all
  platforms, enabling MP3/OGG/FLAC import from both source and PyInstaller builds.
  (`main.py`)
- **Misleading VQ conversion size**: The size shown after conversion (~30KB) didn't match
  the actual .xex size (~7KB). The encoder's estimated size didn't account for nibble
  packing. Fixed by having `MADSExporter.export()` return the actual byte count after
  export, which `builder.py` now stores in `conversion_info.json`. (`vq_converter/`:
  `mads_exporter.py`, `builder.py`; tracker: `vq_convert.py`, `ui_callbacks.py`,
  `ui_refresh.py`)
- **Song editor undo not recorded**: Editing pattern assignments or speed
  values in the song editor via keyboard did not create an undo snapshot.
  Changes were silently permanent. (`keyboard.py`: added `save_undo("Edit song")`
  before `_apply_song_pattern_value` commits)
- **Autosave lost VQ settings**: The `vq_enhance` and `vq_optimize_speed`
  fields were not included in the `EditorState` written by autosave, causing
  these settings to reset to defaults when restoring from an autosave.
  (`ui_globals.py`: added both fields to the autosave `EditorState` constructor)

### Project File Format

- **Simplified and portable .pvq format**: Complete redesign of sample storage:
  - Samples stored as numbered files: `samples/000.wav`, `samples/001.wav`, etc.
  - No paths stored in JSON — sample existence determined by file presence
  - Removed `sample_path`, `original_sample_path`, `sample_file` from serialization
  - Instrument `name`, `base_note`, `sample_rate` are the only persisted fields
  - `sample_path` is now runtime-only, reconstructed on load
  - Changed numbering from `02d` to `03d` to support all 128 instruments
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Project files now fully portable between
  Windows, macOS, and Linux without path separator issues

### Architecture

- **Operations module refactored into `ops/` package**: The monolithic
  `operations.py` (1181 lines) has been replaced by ten focused modules under
  `ops/`, grouped by domain: `base`, `file_ops`, `editing`, `navigation`,
  `playback`, `instrument_ops`, `pattern_ops`, `songline_ops`, `input_settings`.
  The `operations.py` wrapper has been removed; all call sites now
  `import ops` directly.
- **Typed UI callback interface**: Replaced ~15 mutable module-level callback
  variables with `UICallbacks`, a typed dataclass in the new
  `ui_callbacks_interface.py`. All callbacks have safe no-op defaults, so the
  operations layer works even before the UI is wired up. Callback wiring in
  `main.py` now constructs a single `UICallbacks` instance and passes it via
  `set_ui_callbacks()`.

### Code Quality

- **Bare `except:` clauses eliminated**: All bare `except:` and `except: pass`
  patterns replaced with specific exception types and diagnostic logging:
  - `file_io.py`: `OSError` for lock/unlock, `Exception` for fallback paths,
    `scipy`/`wave` read failures now logged at debug/warning level
  - `audio_engine.py`: stream close, callback errors now logged with context
  - `ui_globals.py`: parse errors narrowed to `ValueError`/`TypeError`,
    autosave cleanup errors logged
- **Magic numbers replaced with constants**: Hardcoded `6` (speed) and `64`
  (pattern length) in `audio_engine.py` replaced with `DEFAULT_SPEED` and
  `DEFAULT_LENGTH` from `constants.py`.
- **Removed unused code**:
  - `original_sample_path` field from `Instrument` dataclass
  - `is_converted` parameter from `load_sample()` function
  - `_safe_filename()` function (no longer needed with numbered samples)
  - Backward compatibility code for old project formats

### Testing

- **New test suite**: 86 unit tests across five modules, runnable via
  `run_tests.sh` / `run_tests.bat`:
  - `test_data_model.py` (37 tests): Song, Pattern, Row, Instrument
    creation, serialization round-trip, edge cases
  - `test_file_io.py` (19 tests): Safe filename generation, project
    save/load, format version handling, lock management
  - `test_state.py` (19 tests): UndoManager push/pop/redo, Clipboard,
    Selection, EditorState persistence
  - `test_export.py` (6 tests): Binary and ASM export validation,
    event encoding, note mapping
  - `test_ui_callbacks_interface.py` (5 tests): UICallbacks defaults,
    field assignment, mutation isolation

### File Changes Summary

New files: `ops/` (10 modules), `ui_callbacks_interface.py`, `tests/` (5 test
modules + runner scripts).
Removed: `operations.py`.
Modified: `keyboard.py`, `main.py`, `ui_globals.py`, `ui_callbacks.py`,
`ui_build.py`, `audio_engine.py`, `file_io.py`, `data_model.py`, `vq_convert.py`,
`ui_refresh.py`.
Unchanged: all ASM sources, `build.py`, `state.py`, `constants.py`, `runtime.py`,
`ui_theme.py`, `ui_browser.py`, `ui_dialogs.py`, `analyze.py`, `build_release.py`.
