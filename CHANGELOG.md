## [Beta 4] - 2025-02

### Features

- **MOD Import Options dialog**: Importing a MOD file now shows a dialog with
  two options before import begins. The importer scans the file and shows how
  many volume effects and looped instruments were detected, so you can make an
  informed choice:

  - **Per-row volume control**: When enabled, volume slides and set-volume
    effects from the MOD are faithfully reproduced. The importer simulates the
    original MOD's tick-by-tick volume changes and generates volume-change events
    at every row where the volume differs. This produces accurate fade-ins,
    fade-outs, and volume envelopes. Without this option, volume effects are
    ignored (original behavior).

  - **Extend looped instruments**: When enabled, instruments that use looping in
    the original MOD are automatically extended using the Sustain effect. The
    importer calculates how long each looped instrument needs to play (based on
    the longest note in the song) and unrolls the loop region accordingly. The
    Sustain effect appears in each instrument's effects chain for later editing.
    Without this option, looped instruments cut off at the sample end.

- **Volume-change events (V--)**: New event type that changes a channel's
  volume without interrupting the currently playing note. Displayed as "V--" in
  the pattern editor. Two ways to enter manually: press **~** (tilde) in the
  note column to insert V-- with the current brush volume, or simply type a
  volume value in the volume column on an empty row — V-- is inserted
  automatically. Also generated by the MOD importer when volume control is
  enabled. Requires Vol checkbox to be enabled in Song Info.

- **Sustain effect in instrument editor**: Select a region of a sample
  (left-click = start, right-click = end markers) and repeat it 1–64 times with
  optional crossfade smoothing (0–500 ms). Useful for extending short samples
  into longer sustained notes. Available in the Edit toolbar group.

- **"Used Samples" optimization checkbox**: Limits CONVERT and OPTIMIZE to only
  process instruments actually referenced in the song. Unused instruments are
  skipped during conversion and excluded from the memory budget. The optimizer
  shows a gray "–" next to unused instruments.

- **Configurable Start Address**: Set the player's ORG address ($0800–$3F00)
  in Song Info. Lower values give more room for sample data. Default $2000.

- **Memory Target selector**: Choose target memory configuration in Song Info:
  64KB (no banking), 128KB (130XE), 320KB, 576KB, 1088KB. Extended memory modes
  use bank-switched sample storage.

- **$C000 boundary check**: Assembly build now fails with a clear error if
  code and data exceed the $C000 OS boundary. The build error dialog shows
  available KB and suggests fixes.

- **Extended memory banking (128KB–1MB)**: Full bank-switched sample storage for
  Atari XL/XE extended RAM. Samples are stored in 16KB banks at $4000–$7FFF,
  switched inline in the IRQ handler. Multi-bank samples >16KB span consecutive
  banks with automatic boundary crossing. Includes RAM detection, multi-segment
  XEX generation, and banking-aware optimization.

### Interface

- **Redesigned main layout — Pattern Editor is now the primary panel**: The
  pattern editor spans the full window height on the left side, giving
  significantly more visible rows for editing (~19 rows at default window size,
  up from ~11). The Song grid, Pattern controls, and Song Info are on the right
  side, with the Instruments panel below them.

- **Settings moved to Editor menu**: Settings (Hex mode, Auto-save, Piano keys,
  Coupled entry) are now accessed via Editor → Settings in the menu bar, opening
  in a modal dialog. This frees up screen space for the pattern editor.

- **Mark interval moved to Current section**: The row highlight interval
  selector is now in the CURRENT toolbar alongside Instrument, Volume, Octave,
  and Step — always visible without opening the settings.

- **Real-time CONVERT progress**: The VQ conversion log window now streams
  output line-by-line as the encoder runs, showing iteration progress
  (e.g. "Iteration 12/50...") in real time. Previously output only appeared
  after the entire conversion finished, making it look like the program hung.

### Performance

- **Optimized IRQ player for RAW samples**: The pitch accumulator for RAW
  (uncompressed) samples has been rewritten to combine two separate addition
  stages into one. For 4 active RAW channels, the player now uses 243 of 392
  available CPU cycles (62%) — down from 345 (88%) previously. This frees up
  149 cycles of headroom per IRQ, enough to comfortably handle occasional page
  crosses or additional processing.

- **Fixed audio stuttering on 4-channel note triggers**: When all 4 channels
  triggered simultaneously (common on the first rows of imported MODs), the
  commit phase ran with interrupts disabled for ~604 cycles — far exceeding the
  392-cycle IRQ period. This caused 1–2 missed IRQs and audible stuttering.
  Fixed by restructuring the commit into three phases: deactivate channels
  (no IRQ blackout needed), set up all data (IRQs fire normally, inactive
  channels are skipped), then briefly re-activate (44 cycles with IRQs
  disabled — down from 604).

- **Pre-baked AUDC volume mode bit**: The POKEY "volume-only mode" flag ($10)
  is now pre-baked into sample data at conversion time, removing one instruction
  from the IRQ hot path. Saves 8 CPU cycles per IRQ across 4 channels.

### Bug Fixes

- **OPTIMIZE ignored sample effects (Sustain, Trim, etc.)**: The optimizer
  used a lazy cache that was cleared whenever effects changed, silently falling
  back to the original unprocessed sample data. A Sustain-extended 15-second
  sample would be analyzed as its original 0.5-second length. Now the optimizer
  explicitly runs the effects pipeline before computing sizes and durations.

- **MOD patterns with Dxx/Bxx played silent tails instead of correct length**:
  Pattern break effects now correctly set the pattern length and trim rows.
  Backward position jumps (song loops) truncate the songline list.

- **Banking system shadow register conflicts**: The extended memory detection
  routine now saves and restores PORTB properly, preventing conflicts with
  the OS shadow register on warm resets.

- **Fixed stale text encoding table comment**: Corrected an outdated comment
  that referenced an old encoding format.

- **Removed dead code**: Cleaned up unused `original_sample_path` field,
  duplicate builder files, and an unused export function from the codebase.

## [Beta 3] - 2025-02

### Major Features

- **4-channel polyphonic playback**: Expanded from 3 to 4 independent sample
  channels. All four POKEY audio registers (AUDC1–AUDC4) are now used, giving
  the full hardware polyphony. The 6502 IRQ handler, process_row commit logic,
  and tracker_api all handle 4 channels with complete VQ/RAW mode support.

- **Mixed VQ + RAW sample encoding**: Instruments can now individually use either
  VQ (Vector Quantization) or RAW (uncompressed 4-bit PCM) encoding. VQ gives
  better compression (8:1 with vec_size=8) using a shared 256-entry codebook.
  RAW uses more memory but costs fewer CPU cycles per sample — no codebook
  lookup needed. The player selects the correct handler per channel at note
  trigger time via self-modifying code, with zero overhead during playback.

- **OPTIMIZE button**: Analyzes all instruments and the song arrangement to
  recommend VQ or RAW mode for each instrument. The optimizer simulates
  playback row-by-row to find the worst-case CPU load, then switches short
  or CPU-heavy instruments to RAW when memory allows. After optimization,
  V (VQ) and R (RAW) indicators appear next to each instrument showing the
  recommendation. Toggling an instrument's checkbox preserves these indicators.

- **Amiga MOD import**: Import 4-channel ProTracker .MOD files with automatic
  conversion of patterns, instruments, song arrangement, and speed settings.
  MOD samples are resampled to the POKEY rate and their `base_note` is set to
  C-3 (matching MOD tuning conventions). After import, the optimizer runs
  automatically to assign RAW/VQ modes.

- **Configurable memory limit**: The sample data memory budget is adjustable
  (default 35 KB). The OPTIMIZE button and BUILD process respect this limit
  when deciding how to fit instruments into the Atari's 64 KB RAM.

- **Coupled note entry mode**: New setting (on by default) that controls whether
  entering a note on an occupied cell overwrites the instrument and volume
  (FastTracker 2 style) or preserves them (Renoise-style edit mask). Toggle
  in Settings panel.

- **Clone instrument**: Deep-copies the selected instrument (audio data, effects
  chain, settings) to a new slot at the end of the instrument list.

### Bug Fixes

- **MOD instruments played 2 octaves too high on Atari**: The ASM pitch table
  ignored `base_note`. MOD samples are pitched for C-3 playback, but the
  exporter mapped C-3 to pitch index 24 = 4.0x instead of 1.0x. Fixed by
  extending the pitch table from 36 to 60 entries (5 octaves including 0.25x
  and 0.5x sub-octaves) and applying a base_note correction during export:
  `export_note = gui_note + 24 - (base_note - 1)`.

- **VQ preview cheating vs RAW**: The VQ preview played codebook vectors at
  float32 precision (~24-bit quality) instead of quantizing through the real
  16-level POKEY voltage table. This made VQ sound dramatically better than RAW
  in preview, but the difference does not exist on real hardware. Both VQ and
  RAW previews now go through honest 16-level POKEY quantization.

- **RAW preview used wrong interpolation**: RAW preview used sinc interpolation
  (scipy.signal.resample) creating ringing artifacts. Now uses zero-order hold
  (np.repeat at 1.77 MHz → resample to 48 kHz), matching real POKEY hardware
  sample-and-hold behavior and identical to the VQ preview method.

- **IRQ skip labels fell through into RAW handlers**: Every `chN_skip` label
  in tracker_irq_speed.asm pointed to the same address as `chN_raw_boundary`
  (only comments between, no instructions). On every non-boundary tick, execution
  fell through from skip into the RAW boundary handler. Fixed by placing all RAW
  handlers after the `rti` instruction, reachable only via SMC JMP targets.

- **Branch out of range after removing size optimization**: Removing
  OPTIMIZE_SPEED conditionals made commit blocks exceed the 6502's ±127 byte
  relative branch limit. Fixed by inverting `beq @commit_done_N` to
  `bne @do_commit_N / jmp @commit_done_N`.

- **Atari data size display excluded RAW samples**: The size shown after
  conversion only counted VQ_BLOB + VQ_INDICES. RAW_SAMPLES bytes were never
  added. All-RAW projects showed "2 B". Fixed.

- **Keyboard notes played while typing in Limit field**: The memory limit
  input field did not suppress keyboard note entry, causing notes to trigger
  while typing numbers. Fixed by adding the field to the input-active check list.

- **Optimize indicators disappeared on checkbox toggle**: Clicking a VQ/RAW
  checkbox cleared the optimize result, hiding the V/R recommendation
  indicators. The indicators now persist through checkbox toggles (only cleared
  by operations that change the instrument list or settings).

### Improvements

- **Noise shaping for RAW samples**: 1st-order error-feedback noise shaping
  pushes quantization noise from audible low frequencies to less-audible high
  frequencies. At 15 kHz POKEY rate, noise in the 0–2 kHz band drops by ~18x.
  Auto-enabled when POKEY rate ≥ 6 kHz.

- **2-cycle/channel IRQ optimization**: Data bytes now store raw 0–15 volumes
  instead of pre-baked `$10|vol`. Removes the `AND #$0F` instruction from the
  IRQ hot path, saving 8 cycles per IRQ tick across 4 channels.

- **Removed size-optimized player from tracker**: The tracker now always uses
  the speed-optimized IRQ handler. The size-optimized variant (nibble-packed,
  no RAW support) remains available in the standalone vq_converter.

- **Auto-optimize on MOD import**: After importing a MOD file, the RAW/VQ
  optimizer runs automatically so instruments start with sensible mode
  assignments.

- **Simplified menus**: Removed "Import vq_converter..." and "Export .ASM..."
  menu items. The tracker workflow is now: compose → convert → build (.xex).

## [Beta 2] - 2025-02

### Bug Fixes

- **Windows: WinError 32 when loading .pvq files**: Loading projects failed with
  "The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process".
  Root cause: ZIP archives use forward slashes (`samples/00.wav`) but Windows uses
  backslashes. When checking if source and destination paths were the same,
  string comparison failed due to mixed separators, causing `shutil.copy2()` to
  attempt copying a file onto itself. Fixed with `os.path.normpath()` before
  path comparison. (`file_io.py`)
- **Linux/macOS: FFmpeg not found for MP3 import**: The `_setup_ffmpeg_for_pydub()`
  function only set up the bundled FFmpeg path on Windows. Now works on all
  platforms, enabling MP3/OGG/FLAC import from both source and PyInstaller builds.
  (`main.py`)
- **Misleading VQ conversion size**: The size shown after conversion (~30KB) didn't match
  the actual .xex size (~7KB). The encoder's estimated size didn't account for nibble
  packing. Fixed by having `MADSExporter.export()` return the actual byte count after
  export, which `builder.py` now stores in `conversion_info.json`. (`vq_converter/`:
  `mads_exporter.py`, `builder.py`; tracker: `vq_convert.py`, `ui_callbacks.py`,
  `ui_refresh.py`)
- **Song editor undo not recorded**: Editing pattern assignments or speed
  values in the song editor via keyboard did not create an undo snapshot.
  Changes were silently permanent. (`keyboard.py`: added `save_undo("Edit song")`
  before `_apply_song_pattern_value` commits)
- **Autosave lost VQ settings**: The `vq_enhance` and `vq_optimize_speed`
  fields were not included in the `EditorState` written by autosave, causing
  these settings to reset to defaults when restoring from an autosave.
  (`ui_globals.py`: added both fields to the autosave `EditorState` constructor)

### Project File Format

- **Simplified and portable .pvq format**: Complete redesign of sample storage:
  - Samples stored as numbered files: `samples/000.wav`, `samples/001.wav`, etc.
  - No paths stored in JSON — sample existence determined by file presence
  - Removed `sample_path`, `original_sample_path`, `sample_file` from serialization
  - Instrument `name`, `base_note`, `sample_rate` are the only persisted fields
  - `sample_path` is now runtime-only, reconstructed on load
  - Changed numbering from `02d` to `03d` to support all 128 instruments
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Project files now fully portable between
  Windows, macOS, and Linux without path separator issues

### Architecture

- **Operations module refactored into `ops/` package**: The monolithic
  `operations.py` (1181 lines) has been replaced by ten focused modules under
  `ops/`, grouped by domain: `base`, `file_ops`, `editing`, `navigation`,
  `playback`, `instrument_ops`, `pattern_ops`, `songline_ops`, `input_settings`.
  The `operations.py` wrapper has been removed; all call sites now
  `import ops` directly.
- **Typed UI callback interface**: Replaced ~15 mutable module-level callback
  variables with `UICallbacks`, a typed dataclass in the new
  `ui_callbacks_interface.py`. All callbacks have safe no-op defaults, so the
  operations layer works even before the UI is wired up. Callback wiring in
  `main.py` now constructs a single `UICallbacks` instance and passes it via
  `set_ui_callbacks()`.

### Code Quality

- **Bare `except:` clauses eliminated**: All bare `except:` and `except: pass`
  patterns replaced with specific exception types and diagnostic logging:
  - `file_io.py`: `OSError` for lock/unlock, `Exception` for fallback paths,
    `scipy`/`wave` read failures now logged at debug/warning level
  - `audio_engine.py`: stream close, callback errors now logged with context
  - `ui_globals.py`: parse errors narrowed to `ValueError`/`TypeError`,
    autosave cleanup errors logged
- **Magic numbers replaced with constants**: Hardcoded `6` (speed) and `64`
  (pattern length) in `audio_engine.py` replaced with `DEFAULT_SPEED` and
  `DEFAULT_LENGTH` from `constants.py`.
- **Removed unused code**:
  - `original_sample_path` field from `Instrument` dataclass
  - `is_converted` parameter from `load_sample()` function
  - `_safe_filename()` function (no longer needed with numbered samples)
  - Backward compatibility code for old project formats

### Testing

- **New test suite**: 86 unit tests across five modules, runnable via
  `run_tests.sh` / `run_tests.bat`:
  - `test_data_model.py` (37 tests): Song, Pattern, Row, Instrument
    creation, serialization round-trip, edge cases
  - `test_file_io.py` (19 tests): Safe filename generation, project
    save/load, format version handling, lock management
  - `test_state.py` (19 tests): UndoManager push/pop/redo, Clipboard,
    Selection, EditorState persistence
  - `test_export.py` (6 tests): Binary and ASM export validation,
    event encoding, note mapping
  - `test_ui_callbacks_interface.py` (5 tests): UICallbacks defaults,
    field assignment, mutation isolation

### File Changes Summary

New files: `ops/` (10 modules), `ui_callbacks_interface.py`, `tests/` (5 test
modules + runner scripts).
Removed: `operations.py`.
Modified: `keyboard.py`, `main.py`, `ui_globals.py`, `ui_callbacks.py`,
`ui_build.py`, `audio_engine.py`, `file_io.py`, `data_model.py`, `vq_convert.py`,
`ui_refresh.py`.
